Initial idea was to use [YOLOv7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) model. This model can find objects on images and videos and classify them with high accuracy but such models do not fit to our task, as we do not need to find the object on an image, but rather to classify the whole image.

***Dataset***

The dataset consisted of 101 classes (0-100%)

Train - 70% (135 images) <br>
Validation - 20% (38 images) <br>
Test - 10% (10 images) <br>

The images were grayscaled and rescaled to 64x64px.
